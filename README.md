## 💡 Why AUV?

From the moment I heard about AUV, I knew this was the team I wanted to join. That’s why I didn’t apply to any other technical clubs—AUV is the only one that truly caught my attention.

While the Singapore competition is super exciting, it’s not my main motivation. What really pulls me in is the idea of building an **autonomous underwater vehicle**.

The thought of creating a bot that can operate in a fully 3D environment with unpredictable motion, poor visibility, and underwater challenges is just fascinating. It’s so much more complex than ground robots, and solving those problems is something I’d love to be a part of.

## 🚀 My Journey (So Far)

When I got the shortlist message, I’ll be honest—I barely knew anything about:

- ROS 🤖  
- Git 🛠️  
- Even Python 🐍  

But instead of backing away, I dove in. I started learning everything from scratch, putting in hours every day, and now I can confidently say I’ve made solid progress. I’ve learned how to build packages, write ROS nodes in Python, work with OpenCV, and push everything to GitHub.

## 🙏 Final Words

This isn’t just a submission—it’s something I’ve worked toward and really care about. I’d be super grateful for the chance to learn more and contribute to the amazing work the AUV team is doing.
